These are the codes that I have discovered by hunting for Kolmogorov complexity. All of the values are written in hexadecimal and represent a UTF-8 character that can easily be translated with xxd. Currently, 8 values are known for this program and so far, they have taken exponentially more time to find. (I am working on an eighth and it may take up to a month of CPU and longer if interrupted.)

00: .
01: +.
02: ++.
03: +++.
04: ++++.
05: +++++.
06: ++++++.
07: +++++++.

You may have noticed that there is no difference and we keep on adding more pluses. I am not cheating; these are the best possible solutions that run quickly. But, when does this pattern end? I don't know exactly, but by trying BF emulators, I am pretty sure that it will stop before character 15 (character 21 in decimal) because of the way the program works. I will keep going, even after this pattern is broken.
