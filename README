This is a time bounded Kolmogorov complexity project. It is using the Brainfuck programming language and is "fracking" strings. Each string is derived from a decimal number that is converted into base8 (octal), the language that Brainfuck the programming language that I am using because of its minimalism and Turing completeness.

How it works:

1. A string is given by the user.
2. The program sets a dummy value for the string that we are trying to test for.
3. The program tests the program var/n (the number file) says it needs to test. This number is by default 0.
4. If the output of that program is equal to the string given, we exit.
5. If the condition in step 4 is not met, we go gack to step 3 and repeat until the condition is met.
